# RiskAssessment

The analysis aims to gain insight into the risk level of public listed professional service companies. Specifically, to answer the question that if there is difference between the risk of Large-size and Medium-size professional service companies, and if yes, which portfolio turns to have higher risk. The first part of the analysis explores the individual risk of eight selected professional service companies; the second part split the eight companies into two portfolio, one for large-size companies with market cap over 10 billion US dollars, and the other their mid-counterpart with market cap between 1-10 billion US dollars, and compared the risk between the two groups; and lastly, the third part tried to create the best portfolio that could out-perform the market.
